# rpql: Regularized PQL for Joint Selection in GLMMs

<!-- badges: start -->
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/rpql)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rpql)

`rpql` offers fast joint selection of fixed and random effects in
Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMMs) via regularization. The penalized
quasi-likelihood (PQL) is used as a loss fuction, and penalties are added
on to perform fixed and random effects selection. This method of joint
selection in GLMMs, referred to regularized, is fast compared to
information criterion and hypothesis testing (Hui et al., 2016).

Please note `rpql` is the core workshops function that performed
regularized PQL on a single set of tuning parameters. `rpqlseq` is a
wrapper to permit a sequence of tuning parameter values. The latter is often
what users want to use.


## Installation

install.packages("rpql")
```

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
